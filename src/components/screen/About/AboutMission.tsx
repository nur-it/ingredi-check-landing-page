              I created IngrediCheck out of a personal need that hit close to
              home. Imagine this: You're at the grocery store with your family,
              trying to juggle a dozen dietary restrictions, preferences, and
              food sensitivities. Sounds familiar? That's because, like many of
              you, my family and I were in the same boat.
            </p>
            <p>
              We love exploring new foods, but with our specific dietary
              restrictions, every trip to the grocery store turned into a
              tedious task of reading and re-reading ingredient lists. It was
              exhausting, and frankly, took the joy out of discovering new food
              items.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's where the idea for IngrediCheck was born. With
              IngrediCheck, you can simply save your dietary restrictions in
              natural language and let the app do the rest. Just scan a food
              label, and in seconds, you'll know if it's a fit for you and your
              family. It's like having a personal dietary assistant at your
              fingertips.
            </p>

              But there's more. Ever found something you absolutely loved, only
              to forget its name the next time you shopped? I sure have. With
              IngrediCheck, you can save those great finds, making sure they're
              never forgotten.
